# ECE 10X
> tl;dr we need a place to keep all the crowdsourced solutions in an organised
> way.

## Motivation
ECE courses often lack agreed upon solutions, and Mansour's lectures are
generally unstructured. As a result, it's up to us to help each other out in
understanding the concepts and difficult problems that are presented to us not
only in class but also in practice problems.

## What's Wrong with a Google Doc
Maintaining valid answers, open discussion and avoiding solution typesetting
jankiness are all great reasons to avoid using Google Docs. But perhaps the
biggest reason to using a repo is sustainability. It's much easier to maintain
a github repo, we can share these crowdsourced solutions with the next
generation of SE's when we're in 2A and we should make it as adoptable as
possible.

## How to ask a Question?
Aside from the regular and structured commits regarding the week's lectures,
you may have a specific question involving a mobius/learn/textbook question.
Instead of spamming messenger, or pushing a commit immediately, consider doing
the following...

1. Is there already a solution to my question in the repo? If not...
2. Make a new issue with a descriptive title like
> **"Mobius Excercise 2.23 a) | How
   do I compute the field from a thick slab?"**
3. Add _meaningful_ tags (don't overload, but don't spam) to the issue to help
   people filter through the topics they are interested in solving/reviewing
4. In the body of the issue follow the standard format...

    a. **Location of Problem**: [Steps to easily locate (ie. Mobius Example N)] [link to problem]

    b. **Attach a photo**: [If applicable]

    c. **Clear description of misunderstanding/gap in knowledge**: Do your best
    to state explicitly what you aren't understanding.

    d. **Avoid questions like** "What do I do?" or "What's the solution?" (We'll get to posting full
    solutions later)

## Responding to Questions
Not to strict on this, we'll take what we can get when it comes to solutions.
But some things to keep in mind are as follows:

1. Try and reference the issue you are addressing by appending #[INSERT ISSUE
   NUMBER HERE] to the body of your commit, that way it will appear in the
   issue's tracking.
2. Don't close an issue until someone else has verified your solution (not
   strict)
3. Try to commit either pictures of handwritten notes or better yet LaTeX
   typeset solutions rather than a text document with unintuitive symbols
   everywhere.
